**FAVICON GENERATOR by Team 70**
>Team70 is building a favicon generator(named **IconCity**). Basically, authenticated users will be able to upload an image, generate Favicon in all the standard sizes and formats and the respective HTML codes and then all these would be available in a zipfile which would be downloaded by users who can save their favicons and come back to download them.

>Note: All project contributors much be familiar with the [Rules of Engagement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9N1TRe5wGy6t3cCa-JtPIFo-S4-cVjq1lsBvtaXHqo/edit?usp=sharing)
